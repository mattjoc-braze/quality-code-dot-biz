This repo holds a simple, but problematic Next.js site that badly needs refactoring. Its one and only page fetches a list of products from our CMS and provides an interface for searching and filtering them. Your challenge is ensure that it meets requirements and improve the code quality.

## Challenge

- [ ] Review the code
- [ ] Make it better
  - [ ] Your top priority is to meet the requirements listed above
